# cub3D
my first 3d game

<h1 align="center">cub3D</h1>

Cub3D is a clone of the famous Wolfenstein 3D video game, released in 1992. It is one of the first 3D video games, thanks to the raycasting technique: virtual "rays" are launched from the player and the walls and Obstacles are displayed on the screen according to their distance from the camera. It is therefore a "false" 3D, where the obstacles and enemies are only two-dimensional images.

Carried out as part of the Ã‰cole 42 curriculum, this Cub3D is an ambitious project, programmed in C from scratch using the minilibx graphics library. The basic version (required) simply allows you to move around a map, and the bonus version contains a minimap with the player's viewing angle.
